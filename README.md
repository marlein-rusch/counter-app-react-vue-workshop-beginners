# About

This app was cloned from https://github.com/techomoro/ReactCounterApp.
Is has then been modified to meet the needs of the React/Vue workshop held during the 8 February 2020 Let's Meet Together meet-up.

- Meet-up organizer: Vanessa Ho
- Workshop organizers: Nienke Dekker & Marlein Rusch

## Workshop goals.

Participants should be able to answer the following questions:

- Why use a front-end framework like React/Vue?
- What are the most important differences between React and Vue?
- What are React/Vue components?
- What is state management?

Participants can:

- Set up a React or Vue app
- Integrate CSS into the project
- Make and apply a reusable component
- Manage state (on component level)

# Create React App information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
